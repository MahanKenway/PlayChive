## A browser-first retro game collection

**PLAYCHIVE** is no longer only a Doom WAD launcher. It is a deliberately small, curated collection of independently built browser runtimes: first-person action, top-down combat, adventure, shooters, transport strategy and theme-park strategy. The shell provides discovery, a local library and PSP-inspired touch controls; each game runtime owns its engine, data path and persistence model.

> **Design rule:** a game marked **Ready** includes the free content it needs and launches from the browser. It does not ask the player to upload a commercial archive, create an account or install a native application.

The project is published as a static GitHub Pages site. Its browser runtimes use WebAssembly, a web standard intended to run compiled code efficiently in the browser [1], with Emscripten used by the project’s C and C++ build paths [2]. GitHub Actions builds the deployable artifact and GitHub Pages serves the static result [3].

| Area | What PLAYCHIVE provides |
|---|---|
| **Discover** | A searchable catalog that combines classic WAD material with standalone, free-content games. |
| **Play** | One click opens the relevant browser runtime; bundled entries are designed to start on first load. |
| **Control** | Keyboard, mouse and desktop gamepad support alongside PSP-style touch controls on supported runtimes. |
| **Keep progress** | Game-specific browser-local persistence, plus the hub’s local library and settings. |
| **Respect rights** | Source, asset and license notices remain with each runtime; no commercial game data is repackaged. |

## Live runtime index

The ready entries below are the current focus of the project. Each has a direct link from the main catalog and a dedicated runtime page.

| Runtime | Genre | Content status | Direct page |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Doom / Freedoom catalog** | First-person action | Free WAD bundles and optional local WAD tooling | [Open catalog](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/) |
| **C-Dogs SDL** | Top-down action | Ready with libre upstream game data | [Launch C-Dogs](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/cdogs.html) |
| **GNU FreeDink** | Action-adventure | Ready with redistributable game data | [Launch FreeDink](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/freedink.html) |
| **OpenTyrian2000** | Vertical shooter | Ready with documented freeware data | [Launch OpenTyrian](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/opentyrian.html) |
| **LibreQuake** | First-person action | Ready with LibreQuake Lite data | [Launch LibreQuake](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/librequake.html) |
| **OpenTTD** | Transport strategy | Ready with OpenGFX, OpenSFX and OpenMSX | [Launch OpenTTD](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/openttd.html) |
| **FreeRCT** | Theme-park strategy | Ready with clean-room, free game data | [Launch FreeRCT](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/freerct.html) |
| **Neverball** | 3D physics puzzle | Ready with bundled base data and Easy set | [Launch Neverball](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/neverball.html) |

Two deliberately limited pages remain visible for transparency. **ECWolf** is an engine-only browser host and therefore requires lawfully obtained compatible data selected locally; it is not represented as a zero-friction bundled game. **OpenResident** is a WebGL2/WebAssembly technical probe, not a playable Resident Evil distribution, because its upstream engine source contains no game data.

## Real gameplay, not promotional art

All catalog and README visuals are sourced from actual game or local browser-runtime captures. The images below show fully bundled runtimes in their native interfaces, including Neverball’s real 3D course gameplay.

| OpenTTD browser runtime | FreeRCT browser runtime | Neverball browser runtime |
|---|---|---|
| [![OpenTTD gameplay and menu in a browser.](assets/screenshots/openttd-runtime.webp)](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/openttd.html) | [![FreeRCT title menu over an isometric theme park.](assets/screenshots/freerct-runtime.webp)](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/freerct.html) | [![Neverball 3D physics-puzzle gameplay.](assets/screenshots/neverball-runtime.png)](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/neverball.html) |
| **OpenTTD** uses its free graphics, effects and music sets. | **FreeRCT** uses its project-generated clean-room graphics and data. | **Neverball** uses its bundled base content and Easy level set. |

## Playing PLAYCHIVE

Start at the [main hub](https://mahankenway.github.io/PlayChive/), select a **Ready** game card and choose its launch action. The hub opens independent runtimes in their own pages when the game requires a different engine. On mobile, use the visible D-pad, face buttons and shoulder controls where supplied; on desktop, click the game canvas once if the runtime asks to capture pointer input.

| Task | Recommended action |
|---|---|
| **Play a bundled title** | Select a game marked **Free / bundled** or **Ready**, then use its launch action. |
| **Enter fullscreen** | Use the runtime’s **Fullscreen** control after the canvas has initialized. |
| **Save progress** | Let the game use browser-local storage; do not clear site data if you want to retain saves. |
| **Use a Doom mapset you own** | Use the separate local WAD importer on the main hub. Files stay in the browser session and are never uploaded to a PLAYCHIVE server. |
| **Find a game** | Use catalog search, genre filters and the local pinned library. |

## Runtime architecture

PLAYCHIVE intentionally does not force all games through one emulation layer. The hub is static HTML, CSS and ES modules; the individual runtime pages load their own WebAssembly build and assets. This isolates dependencies and lets each classic engine keep its natural rendering, audio and input model.

## Build and deployment

The authoritative build is [`.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml). On a push to `main` or `master`, it installs the pinned Emscripten SDK, packages the redistributable content, compiles the engine modules, copies the static frontend to `dist/` and deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MahanKenway/RetroPlay.git
cd PLAYCHIVE

# The repository is a static frontend. To inspect an already generated artifact locally:
python3 -m http.server 4180 --directory dist
# Then visit http://localhost:4180/
```

A complete local rebuild needs the pinned Emscripten toolchain plus the prerequisites used by the individual scripts. Use the same order as CI when validating a substantive engine change:

```bash
# After activating a compatible Emscripten environment:
./scripts/build-cdogs-web.sh
./scripts/build-freedink-web.sh
./scripts/build-opentyrian-web.sh
./scripts/build-liberquake-web.sh
./scripts/build-openttd-web.sh
./scripts/build-freerct-web.sh
./scripts/build-neverball-web.sh
./scripts/build-ecwolf-web.sh
```

Do not commit generated `dist/` content. It is a deployment artifact and is rebuilt by CI. For a documentation-only or hub-only change, push to the deployment branch and use the workflow run as the canonical build check.

## Quality and contribution expectations

A contribution should preserve the project’s practical rules: the public build must remain static, an advertised **Ready** runtime must launch with its included lawful content, touch controls must not compromise desktop input, and fullscreen must be exercised before a release. Use actual gameplay captures for catalog art; generated concept art does not substitute for a runtime screenshot.

| Change type | Expected evidence before merge |
|---|---|
| Hub copy, catalog or styling | No broken navigation, correct title/metadata and a checked build artifact. |
| New ready-to-play runtime | Reproducible script, license/source notice, browser launch test, fullscreen test and real screenshot. |
| Runtime control change | Desktop input check and a touch interaction check on the runtime page. |
| Asset/data addition | Clear upstream provenance, license compatibility and no requirement for a player to upload proprietary files. |

Open an [issue](../../issues) for defects, compatibility reports or candidate free-content runtimes. Pull requests should keep attribution files intact and describe both the technical change and the runtime verification performed.

## Licensing and attribution

PLAYCHIVE is a **non-commercial** deployment. The hub does not claim ownership of the engines, game data or artwork represented in the catalog. Each package remains subject to its own license and attribution obligations; the repository keeps runtime-specific notices alongside the relevant bundles and source material.

| Component | Primary licensing / attribution path |
|---|---|
| Hub frontend and browser integration | [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) |
| Doom source lineage | [DOOM source license](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM/blob/master/doomlic.txt) |
| Freedoom and FreeDM bundles | [Freedoom project](https://freedoom.github.io/) [4] |
| C-Dogs SDL | [C-Dogs SDL source](https://github.com/cxong/cdogs-sdl) [5] |
| GNU FreeDink | [GNU FreeDink project](https://www.gnu.org/software/freedink/) [6] |
| OpenTyrian2000 | [OpenTyrian2000 source](https://github.com/opentyrian/opentyrian) [7] |
| LibreQuake | [LibreQuake project](https://librequake.github.io/) [8] |
| OpenTTD and base sets | [OpenTTD](https://www.openttd.org/) [9] |
| FreeRCT | [FreeRCT source](https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT) [10] |
| Neverball | [Neverball source and GPL licence](https://github.com/Neverball/neverball) [11] |
| ECWolf | [`ecwolf/`](ecwolf/) notices and its upstream project |
